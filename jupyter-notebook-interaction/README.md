# Jupyter Notebook and Kernel Interaction

The following scripts are demonstrating the jupyter notebook execution:

 * `run_code_ws_remote.py` - using websockets to achive remote execution
 * `run_code_local_kernel.py` - using `jupyter_client` local client


Note: `pip3 install websocket-client` is need for `run_code_ws_remote.py` to work
On Linux-based distributions install `eog` as file image viewer: `sudo apt install eog`
